It remembers your previous translations and uses the one in the database instead of making new queries when you try to translate the same texts.

## Usage
For now it has not been deployed as an app for windows and linux. Such improvements will be made when the repo gets a star. Until then you can use it as below.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/zfcsoftware/json-translator-app.git
```
```bash
cd json-translator-app
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run start
```

That's the installation! Now go to settings, type your chatgpt api keys one after the other and start the translation process!
